<div class="textblock"><p>Names and Order of Includes:</p>
<p>For the header files, we use google style to include those files. The standard order is: Related header, C library, C++ library, other libraries' .h, your project's .h. All of a project's header files should be listed as descendants of the project's source directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts . (the current directory) or .. (the parent directory). For example, <code>google-awesome-project/src/base/logging.h</code> should be included as: #include "base/logging.h" In <code>dir/foo.cc or dir/foo_test.cc</code>, whose main purpose is to implement or test the stuff in <code>dir2/foo2.h</code>, order your includes as follows:</p><ul>
<li>1. dir2/foo2.h.</li>
<li>2. A blank line</li>
<li>3. C system files.</li>
<li>4. C++ system files.</li>
<li>5. A blank line</li>
<li>6. Other libraries' .h files.</li>
<li>7. Your project's .h files. Another example, the includes in <code>google-awesome-project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cc</code> might look like this: <pre class="fragment">#include "foo/server/fooserver.h"

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include "base/basictypes.h"
#include "base/commandlineflags.h"
#include "foo/server/bar.h"
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the classes should be in the <code>image_tool</code> snamespace.</p>
<p>General Naming Rules:</p>
<p>Names should be descriptive; avoid abbreviation.</p>
<p>Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word. Abbreviations that would be familiar to someone outside your project with relevant domain knowledge are OK. As a rule of thumb, an abbreviation is probably OK if it's listed in Wikipedia. Here are good examples: </p><pre class="fragment">int price_count_reader;    // No abbreviation.
int num_errors;            // "num" is a widespread convention.
int num_dns_connections;   // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
int lstm_size;             // "LSTM" is a common machine learning abbreviation.
</pre><p>These are bad examples: </p><pre class="fragment">int n;                     // Meaningless.
int nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int n_comp_conns;          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int wgc_connections;       // Only your group knows what this stands for.
int pc_reader;             // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
int cstmr_id;              // Deletes internal letters.
FooBarRequestInfo fbri;    // Not even a word.
</pre><p>Note that certain universally-known abbreviations are OK, such as i for an iteration variable and T for a template parameter.</p>
<p>For some symbols, names should start with a capital letter and to have a capital letter for each new word (a.k.a. "Camel Case" or "Pascal case"). When abbreviations or acronyms appear in such names, prefer to capitalize the abbreviations or acronyms as single words (i.e StartRpc(), not StartRPC()).</p>
<p>File Names:</p>
<p>Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores. Examples of acceptable file names: </p><pre class="fragment">my_useful_class.cc
my_useful_class_test.cc
</pre><p>C++ files should end in .cc and header files should end in .h.</p>
<p>Do not use filenames that already exist in /usr/include, such as db.h.</p>
<p>In general, make your filenames very specific. For example, use <code>http_server_logs.h</code> rather than logs.h. A very common case is to have a pair of files called, e.g., <code>foo_bar.h</code> and <code>foo_bar.cc</code>, defining a class called FooBar.</p>
<p>Type Names:</p>
<p>Type names start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores: MyExcitingClass, MyExcitingEnum.</p>
<p>The names of all types — classes, structs, type aliases, enums, and type template parameters — have the same naming convention. Type names should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No underscores. For example: </p><pre class="fragment">// classes and structs
class UrlTable { ...
class UrlTableTester { ...
struct UrlTableProperties { ...

// enums
enum UrlTableErrors { ...
</pre><p>Variable Names:</p>
<p>The names of variables (including function parameters) and data members are all lowercase, with underscores between words. Data members of classes (but not structs) additionally have trailing underscores. For instance: <code>a_local_variable</code>, <code>a_struct_data_member</code>, <code>a_class_data_member_</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Variable names:</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: </p><pre class="fragment">string table_name;  // OK - uses underscore.
string tablename;   // OK - all lowercase.
string tableName;   // Bad - mixed case.
</pre><ul>
<li>Class Data Members:</li>
</ul>
<p>Data members of classes, both static and non-static, are named like ordinary nonmember variables, but with a trailing underscore. </p><pre class="fragment">class TableInfo {
  ...
 private:
  string table_name_;  // OK - underscore at end.
  string tablename_;   // OK.
  static Pool&lt;TableInfo&gt;* pool_;  // OK.
};
</pre><ul>
<li>Struct Data Members:</li>
</ul>
<p>Data members of structs, both static and non-static, are named like ordinary nonmember variables. They do not have the trailing underscores that data members in classes have. </p><pre class="fragment">struct UrlTableProperties {
  string name;
  int num_entries;
  static Pool&lt;UrlTableProperties&gt;* pool;
};
</pre><ul>
<li>Function Names:</li>
</ul>
<p>Regular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators may be named like variables.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, functions should start with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. Here are some examples: </p><pre class="fragment">AddTableEntry()
DeleteUrl()
OpenFileOrDie()
</pre><p>Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) may be named like variables. These often correspond to actual member variables, but this is not required. For example, <code>int count()</code> and <code>void set_count(int count)</code>.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The following rules describe what you should comment and where. But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much better than using obscure names that you must then explain through comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comment Style:</li>
</ul>
<p>Use either the <code>//</code> or <code>/* */</code> syntax. If you want your comments auto generated by oxygen, use <code>///</code> or <code>/** */</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>File Comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>Start each file with license boilerplate.</p>
<p>Legal Notice and Author Line: Every file should contain license boilerplate. In our project, we use styles like <code>Copyright (c) 2015-2018 Daniel Keefe, TAs, &amp; Regents of the University of Minnesota.</code></p>
<p>If you make significant changes to a file with an author line, consider deleting the author line. New files should usually not contain copyright notice or author line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>Every non-obvious class declaration should have an accompanying comment that describes what it is for and how it should be used. Typically, you should use a single file for each class. </p><pre class="fragment">// Iterates over the contents of a GargantuanTable.
// Example:
//    GargantuanTableIterator* iter = table-&gt;NewIterator();
//    for (iter-&gt;Seek("foo"); !iter-&gt;done(); iter-&gt;Next()) {
//      process(iter-&gt;key(), iter-&gt;value());
//    }
//    delete iter;
class GargantuanTableIterator {
  ...
};
</pre><p>The class comment should provide the reader with enough information to know how and when to use the class, as well as any additional considerations necessary to correctly use the class. Document the synchronization assumptions the class makes, if any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by multiple threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants surrounding multithreaded use.</p>
<p>The class comment is often a good place for a small example code snippet demonstrating a simple and focused usage of the class.</p>
<p>When sufficiently separated (e.g. .h and .cc files), comments describing the use of the class should go together with its interface definition; comments about the class operation and implementation should accompany the implementation of the class's methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>Function Comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>Declaration comments describe use of the function (when it is non-obvious); comments at the definition of a function describe operation.</p>
<p>Function Declarations: Almost every function declaration should have comments immediately preceding it that describe what the function does and how to use it. These comments may be omitted only if the function is simple and obvious (e.g. simple accessors for obvious properties of the class). The comment describes the function. Normally, you need to describe: What the inputs and outputs are. For class member functions: whether the object remembers reference arguments beyond the duration of the method call, and whether it will free them or not. If the function allocates memory that the caller must free. Whether any of the arguments can be a null pointer. If there are any performance implications of how a function is used. If the function is re-entrant. What are its synchronization assumptions?</p>
<p>When documenting function overrides, focus on the specifics of the override itself, rather than repeating the comment from the overridden function. In many of these cases, the override needs no additional documentation and thus no comment is required.</p>
<p>When commenting constructors and destructors, just document what constructors do with their arguments (for example, if they take ownership of pointers), and what cleanup the destructor does. If this is trivial, just skip the comment. It is quite common for destructors not to have a header comment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class Data Members:</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of each class data member (also called an instance variable or member variable) must be clear. If there are any invariants (special values, relationships between members, lifetime requirements) not clearly expressed by the type and name, they must be commented. However, if the type and name suffice (<code>int num_events_;</code>), no comment is needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Variables: All global variables should have a comment describing what they are, what they are used for, and (if unclear) why it needs to be global. For example:</li>
<li>Explanatory Comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>Tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments before them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line Comments:</li>
</ul>
<p>Lines that are non-obvious should get a comment at the end of the line. These end-of-line comments should be separated from the code by 2 spaces.</p>
